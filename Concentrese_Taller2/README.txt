Android Lab 1

Javeriana’s Game center has hired you to create an
Android concentration game. The idea of the game is: the
player who finds more cards wins. The cards should be displayed
on the screen using just the background colors instead of
classic background images. In the example image found below, the
grays blocks represent undiscovered cards. Furthermore
application should allow the players to be able to:

1. Configure amount of players and names before the beginning
of the game.

2. See an about menu on the main application menu containing
information regarding creators, player and email.

3. Use on option on the menu to restart the game or create a
new one.

4. Display each player’s score and announce the winner when
the match ends.

5. When the Match ends the application should ask the user if
the player desires to restart the game, start a new one or
close the application.

6. Use the application in Spanish or English.
